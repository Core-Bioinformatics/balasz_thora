# Ephys data analysis

All the code I've written is in `01-analysis.ipynb` which is a Jupyter notebook file (so one needs a Jupyter-compatible software to properly render it).

The structure of the code is pretty linear: one should be able to run all cells in order and generate all plots provided the libraries are all installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, xgboost). It goes from the initial data exploration we discussed, through initial predictions performed, then through the variation analysis we've looked into, then an evaluation of the model, and lastly the plotting of the new data we looked at last time.

The files I'm loading in the code I have from Kenny.

I also include here the PDF presentations in the relevant directory

Hope this helps!
